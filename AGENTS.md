# Agent Instructions for vLLM

> These instructions apply to **all** AI-assisted contributions to `vllm-project/vllm`.
> Breaching these guidelines can result in automatic banning.

## 1. Contribution Policy (Mandatory)

### Duplicate-work checks

Before proposing a PR, run these checks:

```bash
gh issue view <issue_number> --repo vllm-project/vllm --comments
gh pr list --repo vllm-project/vllm --state open --search "<issue_number> in:body"
gh pr list --repo vllm-project/vllm --state open --search "<short area keywords>"
```

- If an open PR already addresses the same fix, do not open another.
- If your approach is materially different, explain the difference in the issue.

### No low-value busywork PRs

Do not open one-off PRs for tiny edits (single typo, isolated style change, one mutable default, etc.). Mechanical cleanups are acceptable only when bundled with substantive work.

### Accountability

- Pure code-agent PRs are **not allowed**. A human submitter must understand and defend the change end-to-end.
- The submitting human must review every changed line and run relevant tests.
- PR descriptions for AI-assisted work **must** include:
    - Why this is not duplicating an existing PR.
    - Test commands run and results.
    - Clear statement that AI assistance was used.

### Fail-closed behavior

If work is duplicate/trivial busywork, **do not proceed**. Return a short explanation of what is missing.

## 2. Development Workflow

### Environment setup

```bash
# Always use `uv` for Python environment management:
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Always install `pre-commit` and its hooks:
uv pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Installing dependencies

```bash
# If you are only making Python changes:
VLLM_USE_PRECOMPILED=1 uv pip install -e .

# If you are also making C/C++ changes:
uv pip install -e .

# If you need to match the CI environment:
uv pip install -r requirements/text.txt
```

### Running linters

```bash
# Run all pre-commit hooks on staged files:
pre-commit run

# Run on all files:
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run a specific hook:
pre-commit run ruff-check --all-files

# Run mypy as it is in CI:
pre-commit run mypy-3.10 --all-files --hook-stage manual
```

### Commit messages

Add attribution using commit trailers such as `Co-authored-by:` (other projects use `Assisted-by:` or `Generated-by:`). For example:

```text
