## Key Features

vLLM comes with many powerful features that include:

- State-of-the-art performance in serving throughput
- Efficient management of attention key and value memory with **PagedAttention**
- Seamless integration with popular HuggingFace models
- Dynamic batching of incoming requests
- Optimized CUDA kernels
- High-throughput serving with various decoding algorithms, including *parallel sampling* and *beam search*
- Tensor parallelism support for distributed inference
- Streaming outputs
- OpenAI-compatible API server

## Performance

vLLM outperforms HuggingFace Transformers (HF) by up to 24x and Text Generation Inference (TGI) by up to 3.5x, in terms of throughput.
