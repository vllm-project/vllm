## About
vLLM is a fast and easy-to-use library for LLM inference and serving.

vLLM is fast with:

- State-of-the-art serving throughput
- Efficient management of attention key and value memory with **PagedAttention**
- Continuous batching of incoming requests
- Fast model execution with CUDA/HIP graph
- Quantizations: [GPTQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323), [AWQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978), INT4, INT8, and FP8.
- Optimized CUDA kernels, including integration with FlashAttention and FlashInfer.
- Speculative decoding
- Chunked prefill

**Performance benchmark**: We include a performance benchmark at the end of [our blog post](https://blog.vllm.ai/2024/09/05/perf-update.html). It compares the performance of vLLM against other LLM serving engines ([TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM), [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) and [LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy)). The implementation is under [nightly-benchmarks folder](.buildkite/nightly-benchmarks/) and you can [reproduce](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/8176) this benchmark using our one-click runnable script. 

vLLM is flexible and easy to use with:

- Seamless integration with popular Hugging Face models
- High-throughput serving with various decoding algorithms, including *parallel sampling*, *beam search*, and more
- Tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism support for distributed inference
- Streaming outputs
- OpenAI-compatible API server
- Support NVIDIA GPUs, AMD CPUs and GPUs, Intel CPUs and GPUs, PowerPC CPUs, TPU, and AWS Neuron.
- Prefix caching support
- Multi-lora support

vLLM seamlessly supports most popular open-source models on HuggingFace, including:
- Transformer-like LLMs (e.g., Llama)
- Mixture-of-Expert LLMs (e.g., Mixtral)
- Embedding Models (e.g. E5-Mistral)
- Multi-modal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA)

Find the full list of supported models [here](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html).
