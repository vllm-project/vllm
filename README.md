## Quickstart
1. Install
```
# export cuda path
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
export PATH="${CUDA_HOME}/bin:$PATH"

# install from source
pip install -e .
# install a helper package using npm
npm install jsonrepair
```

2. Run Server:
```
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --model sanjay920/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct-function-calling-alpha-v1  --dtype auto --api-key token-abc123 --max-model-len 8000 --gpu-memory-utilization 0.96 --enforce-eager
```
## About
vLLM is a fast and easy-to-use library for LLM inference and serving.

vLLM is fast with:

- State-of-the-art serving throughput
- Efficient management of attention key and value memory with **PagedAttention**
- Continuous batching of incoming requests
- Fast model execution with CUDA/HIP graph
- Quantization: [GPTQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323), [AWQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978), [SqueezeLLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07629), FP8 KV Cache
- Optimized CUDA kernels

vLLM is flexible and easy to use with:

- Seamless integration with popular Hugging Face models
- High-throughput serving with various decoding algorithms, including *parallel sampling*, *beam search*, and more
- Tensor parallelism support for distributed inference
- Streaming outputs
- OpenAI-compatible API server
- Support NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, Intel CPUs and GPUs
- (Experimental) Prefix caching support
- (Experimental) Multi-lora support

vLLM seamlessly supports most popular open-source models on HuggingFace, including:
- Transformer-like LLMs (e.g., Llama)
- Mixture-of-Expert LLMs (e.g., Mixtral)
- Multi-modal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA)
