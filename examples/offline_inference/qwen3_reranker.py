# What is the difference between the official original version and one
# that has been converted into a sequence classification model?
# Qwen3-Reranker is a language model that doing reranker by using the
# logits of "no" and "yes" tokens.
# It needs to computing 151669 tokens logits, making this method extremely
# inefficient, not to mention incompatible with the vllm score API.
# A method for converting the original model into a sequence classification
# model was proposed. Seeï¼šhttps://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B/discussions/3
# Models converted offline using this method can not only be more efficient
# and support the vllm score API, but also make the init parameters more
# concise, for example.
# model = LLM(model="tomaarsen/Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B-seq-cls", task="score")

# If you want to load the official original version, the init parameters are
# as follows.

# Why do we need hf_overrides for the official original version:
# vllm converts it to Qwen3ForSequenceClassification when loaded for
# better performance.
# - Firstly, we need using `"architectures": ["Qwen3ForSequenceClassification"],`
# to manually route to Qwen3ForSequenceClassification.
# - Then, we will extract the vector corresponding to classifier_from_token
# from lm_head using `"classifier_from_token": ["no", "yes"]`.
# - Third, we will convert these two vectors into one vector.  The use of
# conversion logic is controlled by `using "is_original_qwen3_reranker": True`.

# Please use the query_template and document_template to format the query and
# document for better reranker results.
