# Scenario 04: Evaluation Rubric

## Scoring (100 points)
- Batching Strategy (30 pts): Continuous batching, dynamic batch sizing
- Priority Handling (25 pts): Priority queues, SLA-based scheduling
- Fairness (20 pts): Starvation prevention, weighted allocation
- Performance (15 pts): Latency/throughput analysis
- Implementation (10 pts): Code quality, data structures

## Level Expectations
**L6 (85-100):** Continuous batching, sophisticated fairness, accurate calculations
**L5 (70-84):** Good batching strategy, basic priority handling
**L4 (55-69):** Understands batching, simple priority approach

## Key Discriminators
1. Continuous vs static batching understanding
2. Fairness mechanism design
3. Performance trade-off analysis
