# Scenario 05: Evaluation Rubric

## Scoring (100 points)
- Isolation Design (30 pts): Multi-level isolation, noisy neighbor prevention
- SLA Management (25 pts): Tier-based guarantees, monitoring
- Cost Attribution (20 pts): Accurate metering, fair billing
- Multi-tenancy (15 pts): Resource pooling, custom models
- Operations (10 pts): Monitoring, debugging

## Level Expectations
**L6 (85-100):** Complete isolation strategy, sophisticated billing, LoRA adapters
**L5 (70-84):** Good isolation, basic SLA enforcement, reasonable billing
**L4 (55-69):** Basic multi-tenancy understanding, simple quotas

## Key Discriminators
1. Dedicated vs shared resource strategy
2. Cost attribution accuracy
3. SLA enforcement mechanism
