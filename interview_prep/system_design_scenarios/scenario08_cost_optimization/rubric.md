# Scenario 08: Evaluation Rubric

## Scoring (100 points)
- Infrastructure Optimization (30 pts): Spot instances, right-sizing, auto-scaling
- Model Optimization (25 pts): Quantization, model routing, distillation
- Request Optimization (20 pts): Caching, deduplication, batching
- Cost Analysis (15 pts): Accurate calculations, cost breakdown
- Trade-offs (10 pts): Performance impact analysis

## Level Expectations
**L6 (85-100):** 50%+ cost reduction, multi-tier optimization, maintains performance
**L5 (70-84):** Good cost strategies, spot instances, basic optimizations
**L4 (55-69):** Understands cost factors, simple optimizations

## Key Discriminators
1. Spot instance strategy and handling
2. Cost reduction percentage achieved
3. Performance maintenance during optimization
