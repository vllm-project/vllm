# Scenario 09: Evaluation Rubric

## Scoring (100 points)
- Traffic Routing (25 pts): Hash-based assignment, consistent allocation
- Metrics Collection (25 pts): Latency, quality, error rates
- Statistical Analysis (25 pts): T-tests, significance testing
- Safety Mechanisms (15 pts): Automatic rollback, gradual rollout
- Quality Measurement (10 pts): LLM-as-judge, human eval

## Level Expectations
**L6 (85-100):** Complete framework, statistical rigor, LLM-as-judge, automatic safety
**L5 (70-84):** Good routing, basic statistics, manual safety checks
**L4 (55-69):** Simple A/B test, manual analysis

## Key Discriminators
1. Hash-based vs random assignment
2. Quality measurement strategy
3. Statistical significance understanding
4. Automatic vs manual safety
