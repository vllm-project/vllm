# Scenario 06: Evaluation Rubric

## Scoring (100 points)
- Quantization Strategy (30 pts): AWQ/GPTQ/INT4, accuracy trade-offs
- Kernel Optimization (25 pts): Flash Attention, TensorRT, fused ops
- Testing & Validation (20 pts): A/B testing, regression detection
- Performance Analysis (15 pts): Speedup calculations, profiling
- Automation (10 pts): Auto-selection, continuous monitoring

## Level Expectations
**L6 (85-100):** Multiple optimizations, automated pipeline, comprehensive testing
**L5 (70-84):** Good optimization knowledge, basic testing
**L4 (55-69):** Understands quantization, manual optimization

## Key Discriminators
1. Multi-stage optimization pipeline
2. Accuracy vs speed trade-off understanding
3. Safe rollout strategy
