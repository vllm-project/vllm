# Scenario 07: Evaluation Rubric

## Scoring (100 points)
- Multi-Region Design (30 pts): Active-active, geo-routing, replication
- Failure Detection (25 pts): Comprehensive health checks, fast detection
- Failover Strategy (20 pts): Automatic failover, state preservation
- Deployment (15 pts): Zero-downtime, rollback capability
- Disaster Recovery (10 pts): Backup, restore, RTO/RPO

## Level Expectations
**L6 (85-100):** Multi-region active-active, <5min RTO, zero-downtime deployment
**L5 (70-84):** Active-passive, good failover, rolling updates
**L4 (55-69):** Basic redundancy, manual failover

## Key Discriminators
1. Availability calculation accuracy
2. Automatic vs manual failover
3. Zero-downtime deployment strategy
