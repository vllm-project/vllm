              body: 'ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Thank you for contributing to the vLLM project.\n Just a reminder: PRs would not trigger full CI run by default. Instead, it would only trigger `fastcheck` CI to run, which consists only a small and essential subset of tests to quickly catch errors with the flexibility to run extra individual tests on top (you can do this by unblocking test steps in the Buildkite run). \n\nFull CI run is still required to merge this PR so once the PR is ready to go, please make sure to run it. If you need all test signals in between PR commits, you can trigger full CI as well.\n\n To run full CI, you can do one of these:\n- Comment `/ready` on the PR\n- Add `ready` label to the PR\n- Enable auto-merge.\n\nðŸš€'
