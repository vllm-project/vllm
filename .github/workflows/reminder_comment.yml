              body: '👋 Hi! Thank you for contributing to the vLLM project.\n Just a reminder: PRs would not trigger full CI run by default. Instead, it would only run `fastcheck` CI which starts running only a small and essential subset of CI tests to quickly catch errors. You can run other CI tests on top of those by going to your `fastcheck` build on Buildkite UI (linked in the PR checks section) and unblock them. If you do not have permission to unblock, ping `simon-mo` or `khluu` to add you in our Buildkite org. \n\nOnce the PR is approved and ready to go, your PR reviewer(s) can run CI to test the changes comprehensively before merging.\n\n To run CI, PR reviewers can do one of these:\n- Add `ready` label to the PR\n- Enable auto-merge.\n\n🚀'
