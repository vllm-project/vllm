              body: 'ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Thank you for contributing to the vLLM project.\n Just a reminder: PRs would not trigger full CI run by default. Instead, it would only run `fastcheck` CI which consists a small and essential subset of CI tests to quickly catch errors. You can run other CI tests on top of default ones by unblocking the steps in your `fast-check` build on Buildkite UI. \n\nOnce the PR is approved and ready to go, please make sure to run full CI as it is required to merge (or just use auto-merge).\n\n To run full CI, you can do one of these:\n- Comment `/ready` on the PR\n- Add `ready` label to the PR\n- Enable auto-merge.\n\nðŸš€'
