# Speculators

Speculators is a library for accelerating LLM inference through speculative decoding, providing efficient draft model implementations that integrate seamlessly with vLLM to reduce latency and improve throughput.

## Why use Speculators?

Large language models generate text one token at a time, which creates a fundamental bottleneck: each token requires a full forward pass through the model, leaving GPU compute underutilized while waiting for memory-bound operations.
Speculative decoding addresses this by using a smaller, faster "draft" model to predict multiple tokens ahead, then verifying them in parallel with the main model.

Speculators provides the following benefits:

- **Reduced latency**: Generates tokens 2-3 times faster for interactive applications such as chatbots and code assistants, where response time directly impacts user experience
- **Better GPU utilization**: Converts latency and memory-bound decoding in the large model into compute-bound parallel token verification, improving hardware utilization.
- **No quality loss**: Speculative decoding does not approximate the target model. Accepted tokens are exactly those the target model would have produced under the same sampling configuration; rejected draft tokens are discarded and regenerated by the target model.
- **Cost efficiency**: Serve more requests per GPU by reducing the time each request occupies the hardware

Speculators is particularly valuable for latency-sensitive applications where users are waiting for responses in real-time, such as conversational AI, interactive coding assistants, and streaming text generation.

## Key features

- **Offline training data generation using vLLM**: Enable the generation of hidden states using vLLM. Data samples are saved to disk and can be used for draft model training.
- **Draft model training support**: E2E training support of single and multi-layer draft models. Training is supported for both non-MoE and MoE models.
- **Standardized, extensible format**: Provides a Hugging Face-compatible format for defining speculative models, with tools to convert from external research repositories into a standard speculators format for easy adoption.
- **Seamless vLLM Integration**: Built for direct deployment into vLLM, enabling low-latency, production-grade inference with minimal overhead.
