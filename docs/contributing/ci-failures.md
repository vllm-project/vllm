# CI Failures

What should I do when a CI job fails on my PR, but I don't think my PR caused
the failure?

- Check the dashboard of current CI test failures:  
  üëâ [CI Failures Dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/vllm-project/projects/20)

- If your failure **is already listed**, it's likely unrelated to your PR.  
  Help fixing it is always welcome!  
    - Leave comments with links to additional instances of the failure.  
    - React with a üëç to signal how many are affected.

- If your failure **is not listed**, you should **file an issue**.

## Filing a CI Test Failure Issue

- **File a bug report:**  
    üëâ [New CI Failure Report](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/new?template=450-ci-failure.yml)

- **Use this title format:**
  
    ```
    [CI Failure]: failing-test-job - regex/matching/failing:test
    ```

- **For the environment field:**
  
    ```
 Still failing on main as of commit abcdef123
    ```

- **In the description, include failing tests:**
  
    ```
    FAILED failing/test.py:failing_test1 - Failure description  
     FAILED failing/test.py:failing_test2 - Failure description  
    https://github.com/orgs/vllm-project/projects/20  
    https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/new?template=400-bug-report.yml  
    FAILED failing/test.py:failing_test3 - Failure description  
    ```

- **Attach logs** (collapsible section example):
    <details>
    <summary>Logs:</summary>

    ```text

## Logs Wrangling

Download the full log file from Buildkite locally.

Strip timestamps and colorization:

```bash
# Strip timestamps
sed -i 's/^\[[0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}T[0-9]\{2\}:[0-9]\{2\}:[0-9]\{2\}Z\] //' ci.log

# Strip colorization
sed -i -r 's/\x1B\[[0-9;]*[mK]//g' ci.log
```

Use a tool for quick copy-pasting:

```bash
tail -525 ci_build.log | wl-copy
```

## Investigating a CI Test Failure

1. Go to üëâ [Buildkite main branch](https://buildkite.com/vllm/ci/builds?branch=main)  
2. Bisect to find the first build that shows the issue.  
3. Add your findings to the GitHub issue.  
4. If you find a strong candidate PR, mention it in the issue and ping contributors.

## Reproducing a Failure

CI test failures may be flaky. Use a bash loop to run repeatedly:

```bash
COUNT=1; while pytest -sv tests/v1/engine/test_engine_core_client.py::test_kv_cache_events[True-tcp]; do  
  COUNT=$[$COUNT + 1]; echo "RUN NUMBER ${COUNT}";  
done
```

## Submitting a PR

If you submit a PR to fix a CI failure:

- Link the PR to the issue:  
  Add `Closes #12345` to the PR description.
- Add the `ci-failure` label:  
  This helps track it in the [CI Failures GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/vllm-project/projects/20).

## Daily Triage

Use [Buildkite analytics (2-day view)](https://buildkite.com/organizations/vllm/analytics/suites/ci-1/tests?branch=main&period=2days) to:

- Identify recent test failures **on `main`**.
- Exclude legitimate test failures on PRs.
- (Optional) Ignore tests with 0% reliability.
