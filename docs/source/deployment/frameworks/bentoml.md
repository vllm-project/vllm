# BentoML

[BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML) allows you to deploy a large language model (LLM) server with vLLM as the backend, which exposes OpenAI-compatible endpoints. You can serve the model locally or containerize it as an OCI-compliant image and deploy it on Kubernetes.

For details, see the tutorial [vLLM inference in the BentoML documentation](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/use-cases/large-language-models/vllm.html).
