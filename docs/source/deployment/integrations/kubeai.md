# KubeAI

[KubeAI](https://github.com/substratusai/kubeai) is a Kubernetes operator that enables you to deploy and manage AI models on Kubernetes. It provides a simple and scalable way to deploy vLLM in production. Functionality such as scale-from-zero, load based autoscaling, model caching, and much more is provided out of the box with zero external dependencies.
