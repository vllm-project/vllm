# Production stack

Deploying vLLM on Kubernetes is a scalable and efficient way to serve machine learning models. This guide walks you through deploying vLLM using the [vLLM production stack](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack). Born out of a Berkeley-UChicago collaboration, [vLLM production stack](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack) is an officially released, production-optimized codebase under the [vLLM project](https://github.com/vllm-project), designed for LLM deployment with:

* **Upstream vLLM compatibility** – It wraps around upstream vLLM without modifying its code.
* **Ease of use** – Simplified deployment via Helm charts and observability through Grafana dashboards.
* **High performance** – Optimized for LLM workloads with features like multi-model support, model-aware and prefix-aware routing, fast vLLM bootstrapping, and KV cache offloading with [LMCache](https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache), among others.

If you are new to Kubernetes, don't worry: in the vLLM production stack [repo](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack), we provide a step-by-step [guide](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack/blob/main/tutorials/00-install-kubernetes-env.md) and a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsTJbQtzj0g) to set up everything and get started in **4 minutes**!

## Pre-requisite

Ensure that you have a running Kubernetes environment with GPU (you can follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack/blob/main/tutorials/00-install-kubernetes-env.md) to install a Kubernetes environment on a bare-medal GPU machine).

## Deployment using vLLM production stack

The standard vLLM production stack install uses a Helm chart. You can run this [bash script](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack/blob/main/tutorials/install-helm.sh) to install Helm on your GPU server.

To install the vLLM production stack, run the following commands on your desktop:

```bash
sudo helm repo add vllm https://vllm-project.github.io/production-stack
sudo helm install vllm vllm/vllm-stack -f tutorials/assets/values-01-minimal-example.yaml
```

This will instantiate a vLLM-production-stack-based deployment named `vllm` that runs a small LLM (Facebook opt-125M model).

### Validate Installation

Monitor the deployment status using:

```bash
sudo kubectl get pods
```

And you will see that pods for the `vllm` deployment will transit to `Running` state.

```text
NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
vllm-deployment-router-859d8fb668-2x2b7        1/1     Running   0          2m38s
vllm-opt125m-deployment-vllm-84dfc9bd7-vb9bs   1/1     Running   0          2m38s
```

**NOTE**: It may take some time for the containers to download the Docker images and LLM weights.

### Send a Query to the Stack

Forward the `vllm-router-service` port to the host machine:

```bash
sudo kubectl port-forward svc/vllm-router-service 30080:80
```

And then you can send out a query to the OpenAI-compatible API to check the available models:

```bash
curl -o- http://localhost:30080/models
```

Expected output:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "facebook/opt-125m",
      "object": "model",
      "created": 1737428424,
      "owned_by": "vllm",
      "root": null
    }
  ]
}
```

To send an actual chatting request, you can issue a curl request to the OpenAI `/completion` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:30080/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "facebook/opt-125m",
    "prompt": "Once upon a time,",
    "max_tokens": 10
  }'
```

Expected output:

```json
{
  "id": "completion-id",
  "object": "text_completion",
  "created": 1737428424,
  "model": "facebook/opt-125m",
  "choices": [
    {
      "text": " there was a brave knight who...",
      "index": 0,
      "finish_reason": "length"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Uninstall

To remove the deployment, run:

```bash
sudo helm uninstall vllm
```

### (Advanced) Configuring vLLM production stack

The core vLLM production stack configuration is managed with YAML. Here is the example configuration used in the installation above:

```yaml
servingEngineSpec:
  runtimeClassName: ""
  modelSpec:
  - name: "opt125m"
    repository: "vllm/vllm-openai"
    tag: "latest"
    modelURL: "facebook/opt-125m"

    replicaCount: 1

    requestCPU: 6
    requestMemory: "16Gi"
    requestGPU: 1

    pvcStorage: "10Gi"
```

In this YAML configuration:
* **`modelSpec`** includes:
  * `name`: A nickname that you prefer to call the model.
  * `repository`: Docker repository of vLLM.
  * `tag`: Docker image tag.
  * `modelURL`: The LLM model that you want to use.
* **`replicaCount`**: Number of replicas.
* **`requestCPU` and `requestMemory`**: Specifies the CPU and memory resource requests for the pod.
* **`requestGPU`**: Specifies the number of GPUs required.
* **`pvcStorage`**: Allocates persistent storage for the model.

**NOTE:** If you intend to set up two pods, please refer to this [YAML file](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack/blob/main/tutorials/assets/values-01-2pods-minimal-example.yaml).

**NOTE:** vLLM production stack offers many more features (*e.g.* CPU offloading and a wide range of routing algorithms). Please check out these [examples and tutorials](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack/tree/main/tutorials) and our [repo](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack) for more details!
