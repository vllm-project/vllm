# Transformers Reinforcement Learning

Transformers Reinforcement Learning (TRL) is a full stack library that provides a set of tools to train transformer language models with methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Reward Modeling, and more. The library is integrated with ðŸ¤— transformers.

Online methods such as GRPO or Online DPO require the model to generate completions. vLLM can be used to generate these completions!

See the guide [vLLM for fast generation in online methods](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/speeding_up_training#vllm-for-fast-generation-in-online-methods) in the TRL documentation for more information.
