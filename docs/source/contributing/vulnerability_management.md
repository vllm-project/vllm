# Vulnerability Management

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

As mentioned in the [security
policy](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/tree/main/SECURITY.md), security
vulnerabilities may be reported privately to the project via
[GitHub](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/new).

## Vulnerability Management Team

Once a vulnerability has been reported to the project, the Vulnerability
Management Team (VMT) is responsible for managing the vulnerability. The VMT is
responsible for:

- Triaging the vulnerability.
- Coordinating with reporters and project maintainers on vulnerability analysis
  and resolution.
- Drafting of security advisories for confirmed vulnerabilities, as appropriate.
- Coordination with project maintainers on a coordinated release of the fix and
  security advisory.

### Security Advisories

Advisories are published via GitHub through the same system used to report
vulnerabilities. More information on the process can be found in the [GitHub
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories).

### Team Members

We prefer to keep all vulnerability-related communication on the security report
on GitHub. However, if you need to contact the VMT directly for an urgent issue,
you may contact the following individuals:

- Simon Mo - simon.mo@hey.com
- Russell Bryant - rbryant@redhat.com

## Slack Discussion

You may use the `#security` channel in the [VLLM Slack](https://slack.vllm.ai)
to discuss security-related topics. However, please do not disclose any
vulnerabilities in this channel. If you need to report a vulnerability, please
use the GitHub security advisory system or contact a VMT member privately.
