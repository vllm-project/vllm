vLLM is a fast and easy-to-use library for LLM inference and serving.

Originally developed in the [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley, vLLM has evloved into a community-driven project with contributions from both academia and industry.

vLLM is fast with:

- State-of-the-art serving throughput
- Efficient management of attention key and value memory with [**PagedAttention**](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html)
- Continuous batching of incoming requests
- Fast model execution with CUDA/HIP graph
- Quantization: [GPTQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323), [AWQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978), INT4, INT8, and FP8
- Optimized CUDA kernels, including integration with FlashAttention and FlashInfer.
- Speculative decoding
- Chunked prefill

vLLM is flexible and easy to use with:

- Seamless integration with popular HuggingFace models
- High-throughput serving with various decoding algorithms, including *parallel sampling*, *beam search*, and more
- Tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism support for distributed inference
- Streaming outputs
- OpenAI-compatible API server
- Support NVIDIA GPUs, AMD CPUs and GPUs, Intel CPUs, GaudiÂ® accelerators and GPUs, PowerPC CPUs, TPU, and AWS Trainium and Inferentia Accelerators.
- Prefix caching support
- Multi-lora support
