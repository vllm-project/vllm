Subtitles: for our annual races at Knockhill Circuit.Today\'s racing comes from the Porsche Carrera Cup Great Britainand the Legends Cars Elite Cup with JLM.It\'s the latter who get us underway with their first race of the day,and joining me in the commentary box is Paul O\'Neill.First race of the day for the Legends.Jonty Norman has drawn pole position,with Matt Knight alongside.Marcus Pett on Row 2 with Daniel Pooley.Declan Burke is next up, and then Tyler Read, on Row 3.He\'s leading the rookie championship at the moment.Chris Needham on Row 4 with Luke Simmons.Andrew Rogerson and Gareth Sheridan on Row 5.Sixth row, Peter Barrable, with Charlie Budd.Row 7, Jack Parker, fourth in the championship right now.Nick Price is next to him.Will Gibson, who looks like he\'s out of the championship contention now,with Oli Schlup alongside.Then Ben McNeice and Flight Lieutenant Matt Isherwood.Robert Barrable, championship leader, he\'s on Row 10.Then Brent Bowie from Kieran Beattie and Nick Bridgeman.Mike Schlup on Row 12, followed by Ryan McLeish,who won the day overall yesterday.Mark Beaty, Row 13, with Andy Bird.Then it\'s Ben Higgins and Nathan Anthony.Connor Mills and Paul Musselle complete Row 15.And completing the grid is James Newbery.Here we go, with Race number 1 of the day,the final day of the first ever Legends Cars Elite Cup with JLM.And on the front row, it\'s Jonty Norman in grey,Matt Knight in black and gold.Coming from third place on the grid is Marcus Pett,who goes left of shot in the gunmetal carto challenge for the lead.Marcus Pett, the man from Boston in Lincolnshire,goes through into lead position.Very definitely a fancied championship runnerbut hasn\'t quite had the rub of the green this weekend.And they all pile into McIntyre\'s for the first time.And this is where we look for driving standards.James Newbery brakes at the back.He\'s got Paul Musselle immediately in front of him.Those two had an interesting battle yesterdayinvolving a little bit of contact, I think,but they\'re both all right at the moment, as they clear the chicane for the first time.Marcus Pett is away.The difference you\'ll see in Legends Cars racing todayis that for this meeting,the bump drafting that we\'ve seen in the pasthas been ruled out for this round,and it\'s under review for the future.But look at the battle for second position, three wide,as Marcus Pett comes in front of the crowds here.Matt Knight on the inside, Dan Pooley on the outside in 32.Dan Pooley challenging for third. He had a strong day yesterday -he was up in the top ten, which was great to see.The man from March.That third car there, eclipsed at the moment,comes out of the slipstream.Dan repaired his own car after Croft,and that of Kieran Beaty,so I know Kieran wanted to thank him for that. He\'s been working hard.And Pooley side by side with Matt Knight.We\'ve got the 13, Chris Needham car, up there in the mix as well.The three top guys in the...Ryan McLeish getting very sideways there,the Scot in the 71 car.The first time we\'ve seen him on our ITV coverage.He\'s not a guest driver this week.I suppose you could technically call him a guest,but he\'s fully championship registeredand took a splendid win yesterday - overall win and race win.Overall on points.Sorry, Paul, gets a chance to get you in.That\'s Jack Parker!Oh, what\'s happened there?So, this was the start. They\'re all still warming the tyres up,ready for the lights to go green,which they do... around about now.And they get going.And then there was a car, wasn\'t there?Oh, I tell you what, that could\'ve ended up really nastyas it snaked up the grass.Yeah, I\'ll tell you what, the moment when the lights went outwas when Marcus Pett broke ranks.That was a very, very meticulous start from Marcus Pett.The blue car here is Tyler Read, top rookie,who looks like he\'s going down the inside of Daniel Pooley,so he\'s gonna make a space here.So, Dan Pooley has lost second position.It\'s Marcus Pett still out front. Matt Knight...I was saying to the drivers,"Don\'t go away if you\'re in the lead because you won\'t get any coverage." Pett\'s down the road, isn\'t he? Look at the gap he\'s got. Yeah.He\'s got three seconds. It\'s gonna be more than that.What I was quite concerned about was the damp part of the circuitdown at the hairpin, where you need to be down the inside of peopleto get the braking done,but these guys seem to be all respecting...Not track limits, but they\'re respecting each other around usbecause I was quite concerned about coming here,but this is quite synonymous with Legends racing at Knockhill.And look at this now. Knight has got...Look at that.  I remember Marcus getting his first race win,which was at Snetterton years ago.It\'s always fantastic to see a first-time winner.And Tyler Read is giving him a great workout.Matt Knight back in third.It\'s between the top two at the moment. Oh! Tyler goes wide.He\'s throwing the car around.Marcus Pett, looking a little bit smoother in the 79,was very frustrated yesterday, but Read\'s all over him.Yeah, but look at this now.You\'ve got third, fourth, fifth and sixth.This is gonna be absolutely spectacular!Tyler Read\'s gone! What\'s gone on?!Oh, has the Treherne engine gone pop? He\'s lost a lot of ground.Is he gonna come back into it?Now it\'s Knight having a go on the outside line again.Matt Knight can\'t do it. He runs out wide.Oli Schlup\'s coming through.Schlup hasn\'t had a win yet in Legends cars, so he\'s queueing up.They\'re coming onto the last lap.This could be a key moment for Oli Schlup,who\'s back in third in the K-Seal car.Across the line.Marcus Pett soaking up the pressure brilliantly so far.But does he need to be in front as they come onto the last lap?I don\'t know, but I think Read must have missed a gear,as someone\'s exited stage left.Look at that, back in the mix!It\'s now six for the lead. Can Pett hold on?Championship leader Robert Barrablehas come through from about three rows from the back,and he\'s at the back of the train.Barrable here is gonna extend his championship leadand start towards the front of the grid for Race 2.Barrable, the Irishman, he\'s there.The white car with the green and orange stripeson the nose cone of the car.But it\'s Marcus Pett out front at the moment... Oh!Matt Isherwood\'s rejoined at the back in the black and green.Isherwood\'s got back at them. Matt Knight\'s having a go.Along Railway Straight.Schlup would normally bump draft him. He can\'t do that on the rules.But look at Marcus Pett.Fairly wide-ish line in. Good defensive stuff from Pett.It\'s all about the run up to the hill now.And Marcus Pett is gonna take the win, I think.Here they come, up towards the line. Pett from Matt Knight.It\'s gonna be Matt\'s best resultin the Legends Cars National Championship.Third position goes to Oli Schlup, who is delighted with that.Then it was Tyler Read. Great race from him.Robert Barrable, though...Barrable, from 19th on the grid, without bump drafting,comes through into fifth placeahead of the excellent recovery from Flight Lieutenant Matt Isherwood.Dan Pooley seventh. Another great result for Dan Pooley.So much to take away from those last racing laps.Oh, and those last four lapsis exactly why we have these Legends on the TOCA package.That was exceptional.Marcus Pett looked like a dead cert not to finish first,but congratulations to you. That was brilliant.But Barrable, after exiting stage leftwhen he caught the back of everybody and got right up there...There\'s too much to talk about. Let\'s just talk about this guy.Pett, you are a legend, mate. Well done.Cracking. It is a lad and dad.Literally, Marcus and his dad, Robert, they look after the car.It is lad and dad. We hear that mentioned in other formulas,but genuinely, that is all it is.It is very difficult for drivers like that and teams like thatto come and race on this stage.It is a big thing. And he\'s such a smashing guy.And his dad as well. Really delighted with the win.Super stuff by Matt Knight. brilliant from Oli Schlup.Fantastic as well from Tyler Read.And on the front row,it\'s Jonty Norman in grey, Matt Knight in black and gold.Coming from third place on the grid is Marcus Pett.Bit of a shemozzle at the back.Two cars hooked up, which is not good to see.Oh, has the Treherne engine gone pop? He\'s lost a lot of ground.Now it\'s Knight having a go on the outside line again.Matt Knight can\'t do it. He runs out wide.Oli Schlup\'s coming through.And Marcus Pett is gonna take the win, I think. Pett from Matt Knight. It\'s gonna be Matt\'s best resultin the Legends Cars National Championship.Here\'s how they finished.Marcus Pett takes another win in the Legends Cars Elite Cup with JLM.READS INFOREADS INFOREADS INFOREADS INFOREADS INFOREADS INFOProblems in that race for Ryan McLeish, yesterday\'s winner.Charlie Budd in 30th.And the other driver having problems, obviously,from that first stoppage, Brent Bowie.Marcus, that was a tough racebecause there was a red flag in the middle of it.Actually, the first bit, you got away,but it was a full reset,and pressure throughout to the chequered flag.Yeah, definitely.We had an ideal start and managed to build up a lead early on,which was great, but when you\'re in that position,the last thing you want to see is a red flag. iming line at the end of lap one.So, Gus Burton leads the way.Big, big dive by Foster on the inside,to go back ahead of Wylie.He goes off the road and back on again.He\'s all sideways.And diving up on the outside line comes Ryan Ratcliffe.Wylie here battling with one of the Pro category cars,but behind him, all the Pro-Am opposition crawling all over him.Well, that was dramatic stuff, wasn\'t it?Round the outside of Turn 1, put Harry Foster in the wrong place.That was Max Bird going wide, number 44, the pink and blue car.So that\'s just haemorrhaged places in Pro-Am.And he\'s the... Oh, a puncture.There\'s somebody with a puncture. Is that Angus Whiteside? Possibly.Let\'s see.I think it is. And you\'ve got this damp patch on the inside,on the braking there, just at the final into the hairpin.This has been a dramatic start to this race for Porsches.Absolutely right.Coming up over the timing line, Gus Burton leads the way.Nine tenths of a second to the good.Big effort being made by Jason Lockwoodin the yellow and orange car in the background, look,to try to get up the inside line, then diving down towards Turn 1.Goes ahead of Oliver White, the very experienced Formula 4 champion.In the silver car, Oliver White, back into Carrera Cup.Remember, he did a full season last year.Good to have him back on the grid.As the cars clamber their way up over the kerb,through the chicane.But Gus Burton saying to everybody, "I\'m back." He leads.Yeah, a dramatic way for Gus Burton to come back to this championship.Remember, he started this year with Century Motorsport but then ducked out of the championship prior to Thruxton.He\'s still competing in the Supercup series with Fach Auto.As there in the pits, getting a new rear left tyre, is Angus Whiteside.But Gus Burton absolutely on it.Very quick in testing here during the week.They tested on Wednesday and on Friday.Gus Burton very quick in...And he\'s really enjoying life now.Back in the championship with the NAPA Racing UK supportand with a different team, Nick Tandy\'s JTR outfit.And he\'s done the fastest lap of the race, as he leads.He is not in the championship fight, but he wants to win races.Car off. It\'s Max Bird again.So, Max Bird, the Pro-Am championship leader,three times a winner in class this year,off the road and back on again.But that\'s gonna throw him way, way down the order.This race is going from bad to worse for him.It\'s just completely unfolded for poor Max Bird.That\'s the curse of having our camera on board, I think,but it\'s just unravelled after a great qualifying.Now, you were talking about Gus Burton\'s start,and it is going to be investigated after the race.OK. Well, it\'ll take a lot of camera action analysisto look at it. This is on board with Bird.Round Turn 1.All OK there. Very close... Goes to the outside.That\'s dangerous cos you can get knocked wide,and that\'s exactly what happens.The man he was trying to get past, Josh Stanton,who spent last night trackside at Cowdenbeath watching stock cars.I\'m not suggesting for a moment he\'s learnt how to defend,but he was enjoying himself, watching a different form of racing.I think all the best people were at Cowdenbeath, weren\'t they?Nick Tandy was, and others. Oh!As there, absolutely on the giddy limit, is Harry Foster,making his way in sixth place.Down towards the hairpin.He\'s dropped back from that leading quintet,but he\'s keeping Ross Wylie at bay.Ross Wylie, there, creeping into shot, leads now Pro-Amahead of Ryan Ratcliffe.And Josh Stanton is third in Pro-Am, last year\'s Am champion.Yeah, and Ross Wylie the only Scottish driver in the race. A lot of support for him,from local sponsors as well as the public.Buoyed by his recent run at the British Grand Prix at Supercup,and thoroughly loving racing at his home circuit, Ross Wylie.Track is nicely dry.There was some threats of possible rain.We had rain yesterday during qualifying.They actually only got one runon their slick tyres yesterday in qualifyingbefore the rain arrived, and that set the grid.So, Gus Burton\'s lead growing all the time.1.3 seconds now, that margin over Adam Smalley.As Max Bird tries to fight back in Pro-Am.Gets up the inside line there.So, that puts him ahead of David Stirling.So, he\'s split the second and third Am fightas he tries to recover.Yeah, but he\'s lost a lot of ground with that momenton the outside of McIntyre\'s.It\'s getting a lot darker overhead at Knockhill,even though there is a break in the cloud.A big effort there from the lapped car of Angus Whiteside.He\'s not fighting for position, he\'s trying to unlap himself.But just wonder whether we might get so f the right of McIntyre\'s,up towards Butcher\'s, then the chicane.And looking to try and maintain this 100% recordin the Team Parker Racing-run car in Am.Yeah. David Fairbrother in second place,but some 11 seconds behind in the Am category.But he will take another podium.His second in the championship, too, Justin Sherwood.The race leader 2.5 seconds to the good, Gus Burton.Other battles still to be resolved.What\'s going on in Pro-Am? Ross Wylie leads.He\'s fallen back behind Josh Malin overall. That was the move.Josh Malin through on the inside at the hairpin.Ross Wylie, in a sense, content to let that happen - gave him room -because that\'s not his battle, but what it does meanis that Ryan Ratcliffe, his class rival,is directly behind him.This is William Aspin versus Max Bird for sixth in Pro-Am.And a very determined Max Bird goes one side, get his nose chopped off.Will Aspin, the man from Florence, defends on the other side.They\'re absolutely together, almost touching.Here comes Max Bird.Oh, but he can\'t find a way through there.Angus Whiteside is now getting in on the act.Round the outside goes Max Bird, but they both take it wide,and through goes Angus Whiteside on the inside.Doesn\'t affect the race order.Whiteside unlaps himself from those two cars. Will Aspin stays ahead. Max Bird tries to fight back.Down towards Duffus Dip.Ignore the car in the lead of this battle packbecause it\'s not on the lead lap.But then Aspin under attack.Max Bird tries to get up alongside himfor the inside line coming into McIntyre\'s.He is on the inside, and he is ahead now.Yeah. And behind him, there was a car completely off on the grassafter Turn 1.So I do think that section of the track is a little slippery,for whatever reason. Maybe it just hasn\'t quite dried out.But this was a great battle between Max Bird and Will Aspin.So, drivers, in one or two cases,setting personal best lap times last time around,suggesting that the road is drying still.The cars are getting lighter on fuel anyway.Down at the hairpin comes the recovering Max Bird,as over the line goes Harry Foster, being chased by Josh Malin.Josh up into seventh overall.A top six could be on - he\'s only half a second back.Yeah, it\'s not far away, is it?And still plenty of laps left in this race.You probably noticed through that Turn 1the drivers are not riding the big kerb on the inside.That\'s because it\'s a new kerb that\'s been put in, actually,to raise the level of the kerbback to the level it was before the track got resurfaced twice.But with the resurfacing twice,it had raised the track surface by 80mm,and the drivers found they were, in previous years,able to use that kerb.Now? Not so much.So, there going through is Oliver Wight in the silver car,down towards the hairpin.Jason Lockwood ahead of him.Jason for EXCELR8, and he is running in 12 at the moment,which is potentially going to be his best finish of the year.It\'s been a tough season for Jason,but he could be on for his best results thus far.However, Gus Burton has rather dominated this,and look at the gap that he\'s pulled.Adam Smalley, as we suggested earlier,might be thinking about banking points,but it doesn\'t look as though he\'s been able to do anything at allabout that JTR car ahead.No. In terms of pure speed,he hasn\'t been able to threaten Gus Burton at all, has he? Gus Burton has led every race.As he\'s now passing David Fairbrotherat the back of the field.But he\'s had this race under control.But unfortunately, he\'s got this investigation after the racefor a possible false start hanging over him.And if, if, if anything is found, and it\'s a false start,normally that\'s a ten-second penalty,and he\'s not ten seconds ahead,so there is gonna be a postscript to this story, that\'s for sure.Now, this is Henry Dawes, Ollie Jacksoncoming through the chicane.Dawes goes wide, goes through the gravel,goes over the grass, loses a place,gets it all sideways, but just about saves it by the end of the straight.Yeah, nearly lost it on the wet grass.Oh. Harry Foster.This is passing David Fairbrother again, further back.So, this is Smalley versus Matty Graham for second place.So, this gap has come r. \n\n Your task is to create long detailed paragraph-by-paragraph summary.
