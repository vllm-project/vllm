##Instruction:
farm contains tables such as city, farm, farm_competition, competition_record. Table city has columns such as City_ID, Official_Name, Status, Area_km_2, Population, Census_Ranking. City_ID is the primary key.
Table farm has columns such as Farm_ID, Year, Total_Horses, Working_Horses, Total_Cattle, Oxen, Bulls, Cows, Pigs, Sheep_and_Goats. Farm_ID is the primary key.
Table farm_competition has columns such as Competition_ID, Year, Theme, Host_city_ID, Hosts. Competition_ID is the primary key.
Table competition_record has columns such as Competition_ID, Farm_ID, Rank. Competition_ID is the primary key.
The Host_city_ID of farm_competition is the foreign key of City_ID of city.
The Farm_ID of competition_record is the foreign key of Farm_ID of farm.
The Competition_ID of competition_record is the foreign key of Competition_ID of farm_competition.
