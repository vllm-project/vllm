# Lab 06: Custom Allocators - Memory Pools and Custom Allocation

## Overview
Learn to write custom memory allocators for performance-critical applications. Essential for GPU memory management and reducing allocation overhead.

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand C++ allocator interface
2. Implement a memory pool allocator
3. Use custom allocators with STL containers
4. Benchmark custom vs standard allocators
5. Apply to GPU-like memory management

## Estimated Time
2 hours

## Prerequisites
- Memory management (Lab 01)
- Understanding of heap allocation

## Connection to vLLM
- KV cache memory pooling
- Reducing GPU memory fragmentation
- Fast allocation for inference batches
