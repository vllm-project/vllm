# Study 4: What is optimal reorder_batch_threshold for MLA backends supporting query length > 1?
# Question: At what query length does prefill pipeline become faster than decode pipeline?
# Methodology: For each query length, compare decode vs prefill performance to find crossover point
# Applies to: FlashAttn MLA, FlashMLA

description: "Decode vs Prefill pipeline crossover analysis"

# Test FlashAttn MLA
backend: flashattn_mla

# Mode: decode_vs_prefill comparison (special sweep mode)
# For each batch spec, we'll test both decode and prefill pipelines
mode: "decode_vs_prefill"

# Query lengths to test (from old benchmark_mla_threshold.py methodology)
# Each query length will be tested with BOTH decode and prefill pipelines:
#   - decode: threshold >= query_length (forces decode pipeline)
#   - prefill: threshold < query_length (forces prefill pipeline)
#
# We use q<N>s1k format which creates q_len=N, seq_len=1024 requests
# This tests different query lengths with fixed sequence length context
#
# Using batch_spec_ranges for automatic generation:
batch_spec_ranges:
  - template: "q{q_len}s1k"
    q_len:
      start: 1
      stop: 16
      step: 1
      end_inclusive: false
  - template: "q{q_len}s1k"
    q_len:
      start: 16
      stop: 64
      step: 2
      end_inclusive: false
  - template: "q{q_len}s1k"
    q_len:
      start: 64
      stop: 1024
      step: 4
      end_inclusive: true

# Batch sizes to test (from old script)
batch_sizes:
  - 1
  - 2
  - 4
  - 8
  - 16
  - 32
  - 64
  - 128
  - 256

# Model configuration (DeepSeek V2/V3 defaults)
model:
  num_layers: 10
  head_dim: 576
  num_q_heads: 128
  num_kv_heads: 1
  block_size: 128

# Benchmark settings
device: "cuda:0"
repeats: 15          # More repeats for spec decode variance
warmup_iters: 5
profile_memory: false

# Output
output:
  csv: "reorder_threshold_results.csv"
  json: "reorder_threshold_results.json"

# Expected outcome (reproduces old benchmark_mla_threshold.py study):
# - For each batch size, find the crossover point where prefill becomes faster than decode
# - Show decode vs prefill performance across all query lengths
# - Determine optimal reorder_batch_threshold based on last query length where decode is faster
# - Understand how crossover point varies with batch size
# - Provide data-driven guidance for default threshold value
#
# Methodology (from old script):
# - Each query length tested with BOTH pipelines:
#     * decode: threshold >= query_length (forces decode pipeline)
#     * prefill: threshold < query_length (forces prefill pipeline)
# - Compare which is faster to find crossover point
