# Study 2: Does head count matter for FlashAttn MLA vs FlashMLA on Hopper?
# Question: Which backend performs better on Hopper GPUs (SM90+)?
# Question: Does the number of attention heads affect relative performance?

# Comprehensive batch spec matrix: batch sizes × query lengths
# Batch sizes (num requests): 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
# Note: FlashMLA has IMA issues for batch_size > 16, so limiting to ≤ 16
# Query lengths: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512

# Model configuration
model:
  num_layers: 10
  head_dim: 576        # MLA uses 576
  num_q_heads: 128     # Default value (will be overridden by sweep)
  num_kv_heads: 1      # MLA uses single KV head
  block_size: 64

# Model parameter sweep - test different head counts
model_parameter_sweep:
  param_name: "num_q_heads"
  values: [16, 32, 64, 128, 256]
  label_format: "{backend}_heads_{value}"

# Benchmark settings
benchmark:
  device: "cuda:0"
  repeats: 10
  warmup_iters: 5
  profile_memory: true  # Track memory usage differences

# Output
output:
  csv: "hopper_head_count_results.csv"
  json: "hopper_head_count_results.json"

# Expected outcome:
# - Determine which backend is faster on Hopper
# - Identify if head count impacts relative performance
# - Inform backend selection for DeepSeek V2/V3 models
