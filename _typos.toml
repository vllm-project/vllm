# TEMPORARY TYPO DEBT LEDGER
# -------------------------
# This file explicitly lists ALL tokens that typos should ignore.
# It includes:
#   - Domain-specific identifiers (correct-by-design)
#   - Known real misspellings (temporary, to be fixed later)
#
# Delete entries gradually as typos are cleaned up.
