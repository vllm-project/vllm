This Docker image, created by the AMD Team, is designed to deliver optimal performance with all existing optimizations included. We highly recommend using this pre-built image instead of building one from scratch. Thank you.
This Docker image packages vLLM with PyTorch for an AMD Instinct™ MI300X accelerator. It includes:

✅ ROCm™ 6.2.1
✅ vLLM 0.6.4
✅ PyTorch 2.5.0
✅ Tuning files (.csv format)
With this Docker image, users can quickly validate the expected inference performance numbers on the MI300X accelerator. This guide also provides tips and techniques so that users can get optimal performance with popular AI models.
Reproducing benchmark results 🚀
https://github.com/ROCm/MAD/blob/develop/benchmark/vllm/README.md

docker pull rocm/vllm:rocm6.2_mi300_ubuntu20.04_py3.9_vllm_0.6.4

Use the following instructions to reproduce the benchmark results on an MI300X accelerator with a prebuilt vLLM Docker image.

Users have two choices to reproduce the benchmark results.

MAD-integrated benchmarking
Standalone benchmarking
NUMA balancing setting
To optimize performance, disable automatic NUMA balancing. Otherwise, the GPU might hang until the periodic balancing is finalized. For further details, refer to the AMD Instinct MI300X system optimization guide.

# disable automatic NUMA balancing
sh -c 'echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/numa_balancing'
# check if NUMA balancing is disabled (returns 0 if disabled)
cat /proc/sys/kernel/numa_balancing
0
Download the Docker image 🐳
The following command pulls the Docker image from Docker Hub.

docker pull rocm/vllm:rocm6.2_mi300_ubuntu20.04_py3.9_vllm_0.6.4
MAD-integrated benchmarking
Clone the ROCm Model Automation and Dashboarding (MAD) repository to a local directory and install the required packages on the host machine.

git clone https://github.com/ROCm/MAD
cd MAD
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use this command to run a performance benchmark test of the Llama 3.1 8B model on one GPU with float16 data type in the host machine.

export MAD_SECRETS_HFTOKEN="your personal Hugging Face token to access gated models"
python3 tools/run_models.py --tags pyt_vllm_llama-3.1-8b --keep-model-dir --live-output --timeout 28800
ROCm MAD launches a Docker container with the name container_ci-pyt_vllm_llama-3.1-8b. The latency and throughput reports of the model are collected in the following path:

~/MAD/reports_float16/
Although the following models are pre-configured to collect latency and throughput performance data, users can also change the benchmarking parameters. Refer to the Standalone benchmarking section.

Available models
model_name
pyt_vllm_llama-3.1-8b
pyt_vllm_llama-3.1-70b
pyt_vllm_llama-3.1-405b

pyt_vllm_llama-2-70b
pyt_vllm_mixtral-8x7b

Standalone benchmarking
Users also can run the benchmark tool after they launch a Docker container.

docker pull rocm/vllm:rocm6.2_mi300_ubuntu20.04_py3.9_vllm_0.6.4
docker run -it --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --group-add video --shm-size 128G --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --security-opt apparmor=unconfined --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE -v $(pwd):/workspace --env HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE=/workspace --name vllm_v0.6.4 rocm/vllm:rocm6.2_mi300_ubuntu20.04_py3.9_vllm_0.6.4
Now clone the ROCm MAD repository inside the Docker image and move to the benchmark scripts directory at ~/MAD/scripts/vllm.

git clone https://github.com/ROCm/MAD
cd MAD/scripts/vllm
Command
./vllm_benchmark_report.sh -s $test_option -m $model_repo -g $num_gpu -d $datatype
Note

The input sequence length, output sequence length, and tensor parallel (TP) are already configured. You don't need to specify them with this script.

Note

If you encounter this error, pass your access-authorized Hugging Face token to the gated models.

OSError: You are trying to access a gated repo.

Here are some examples and the test results:

Benchmark example - latency

Use this command to benchmark the latency of the Llama 3.1 8B model on one GPU with the float16 and float8 data type.

./vllm_benchmark_report.sh -s latency -m meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct -g 1 -d float16
./vllm_benchmark_report.sh -s latency -m amd/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-FP8-KV -g 1 -d float8
The latency reports are available at:

./reports_float16/summary/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct_latency_report.csv
./reports_float8/summary/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-FP8-KV_latency_report.csv
Benchmark example - throughput

Use this command to benchmark the throughput of the Llama 3.1 8B model on one GPU with the float16 and float8 data type.

./vllm_benchmark_report.sh -s throughput -m meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct -g 1 -d float16
./vllm_benchmark_report.sh -s throughput -m amd/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-FP8-KV -g 1 -d float8
The throughput reports are available at:

./reports_float16/summary/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct_throughput_report.csv
./reports_float8/summary/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-FP8-KV_throughput_report.csv
Note

Throughput is calculated as:

throughput_tot = requests * (input lengths + output lengths) / elapsed_time
throughput_gen = requests * output lengths / elapsed_time
