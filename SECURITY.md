## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in vLLM, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

Please report security issues privately using [the vulnerability submission form](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/new). Reports will then be triaged by the [vulnerability management team](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/contributing/vulnerability_management.html).
