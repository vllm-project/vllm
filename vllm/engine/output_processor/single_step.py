    """SequenceGroupOutputProcessor which handles "output processing" logic,
    which happens after the model returns generated token ids and before
    scheduling of the next batch. Output processing logic includes
    detokenization, and determining if a sequence is finished (e.g. via max len
    or eos token).

    The SingleStepOutputProcessor is specialized to the case where the model
    emits at most a single token per invocation, which precludes configurations
    such as speculative decoding or multi-step decoding. This enables beam
    search sampling, which requires forking/finishing/freeing sequences in a way
    that is currently difficult to schedule multiple steps ahead of time.
