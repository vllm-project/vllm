    """SequenceGroupOutputProcessor which handles logic related to
    detokenization and stopping conditions. It specializes to "multi-step
    decoding", where vLLM's worker may generate multiple tokens per invocation.
    This is currently mutually exclusive with advanced sampling techniques like
    beam search, which motivates the separation of this logic from the single
    step output processor.

    This class is responsible for things such as correctly appending all new
    token ids to their sequence, detokenizing new token ids, truncating new
    output tokens after an eos token, and correctly handling the case where the
    number of new output tokens per sequence differs in a single batch.
