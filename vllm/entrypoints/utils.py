    This does _not_ use request.is_disconnected, which does not work with
    middleware. Instead this follows the pattern from 
    starlette.StreamingResponse, which simultaneously awaits on two tasks- one
    to wait for an http disconnect message, and the other to do the work that we
    want done. When the first task finishes, the other is cancelled.

    A core assumption of this method is that the body of the request has already
    been read. This is a safe assumption to make for fastapi handlers that have
    already parsed the body of the request into a pydantic model for us.
    This decorator is unsafe to use elsewhere, as it will consume and throw away
    all incoming messages for the request while it looks for a disconnect
    message.

    In the case where a `StreamingResponse` is returned by the handler, this
    wrapper will stop listening for disconnects and instead the response object
    will start listening for disconnects.
