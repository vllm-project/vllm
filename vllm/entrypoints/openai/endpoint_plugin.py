"""Contract for `vllm.endpoint_plugins` entry points.

An endpoint plugin adds HTTP routes to the OpenAI compatible API server.
Its scope is HTTP surface only. It registers routes and optionally
per app state used by those routes. It must not open new paths into the
engine by reaching the engine the same way an in-tree serving handler does
via `EngineClient` (e.g. `engine_client.collective_rpc(...)`).

If a plugin also needs engine side behavior (a new worker side RPC method,
a custom stat, etc.) pair this entry point with one registered under
`vllm.general_plugins` (see `vllm/plugins/__init__.py`). The
`general_plugins` entry installs the engine side method and the
`endpoint_plugins` entry exposes it over HTTP. The two are registered and
loaded independently where neither implies the other.

Plugins are opt-in. See `load_endpoint_plugins` in `vllm/plugins/__init__.py`
for the loading/gating rules and `docs/usage/security.md` for the security
posture of exposing plugin defined routes.

Endpoint plugins are not supported on the CPU only render server (see
`build_and_serve_renderer` in `vllm/entrypoints/openai/api_server.py`).
This is because it has no `EngineClient`, so `init_state` below has nothing
to receive.
