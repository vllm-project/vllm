KVConnectorBase_V1 Class for Distributed KV Cache & Hidden State
communication in vLLM v1

The class provides the following primitives:
    Scheduler-side: runs in the scheduler, binds metadata, which
    is used by the worker-side to load/save KV cache.
        get_num_new_matched_tokens() - get number of new tokens 
            that exist in the remote KV cache. Might be called multiple
            times for a given request and should be side-effect free.
        update_state_after_alloc() - update KVConnector state after
            temporary buffer alloc by the CacheManager.
        update_connector_output() - update KVConnector state after
            output is received from worker-side connectors.
        request_finished() - called when a request is finished, with
            the computed kv cache blocks for the request.
            Returns whether KV cache should be freed now or will be
            freed asynchronously and optionally returns KV transfer
            params.
        take_events() - returns new KV events that were collected
            by the connector since the last call.

    Worker-side: runs in each worker, loads/saves KV cache to/from
    the Connector based on the metadata.
        start_load_kv() - starts loading all KVs (maybe async)
        wait_for_layer_load() - blocks until layer i load is done

        save_kv_layer() - starts saving KV for layer i (maybe async)
        wait_for_save() - blocks until all saves are done

        get_finished() - called with ids of finished requests, returns
            ids of requests that have completed async sending/recving.
