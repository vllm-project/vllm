"""Push-specific (WRITE) worker-side logic for the NIXL connector.

A dedicated ``nixl-push-writer`` thread owns all push-related NIXL ops:
calls ``get_new_notifs`` (routing PUSH_REG internally; HB / completion
notifs are forwarded to the engine main thread), sends PUSH_REG via
``send_notif``, matches D registrations with P finished blocks, and
issues WRITE transfers via ``make_prepped_xfer`` / ``transfer``.

The engine main thread feeds the writer through queues:
``_reg_send_inbox`` (D-side regs to send), ``_finished_blocks_inbox``
(P-side blocks from metadata) and ``_pending_completion_notifs``
(non-PUSH_REG notifs forwarded back for HB / completion accounting).
The handshake-completion callback feeds ``_deferred_push_inbox`` with
matched pushes whose P→D handshake has finished so the writer can
(re-)issue the WRITE without ever blocking on the network.

Wake model: the writer self-polls every
``_PUSH_WRITER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`` only while it has unmatched
``_push_finished_blocks`` (i.e. P-side blocks waiting for a D PUSH_REG
notif that has no other wake source). All other progress is
event-driven: the engine main thread sets ``_push_writer_wake`` from
``start_load_kv`` (when handing it new work) and from ``get_finished``
(so each engine step gives the writer a chance to drain NIXL notifs);
the handshake-completion callback sets the same event after a deferred
PUSH_REG send or a deferred push WRITE has been queued. When a request's
lease expires (the base worker reports it via ``done_sending``) or the WRITE completes,
``get_finished`` enqueues an eviction onto ``_evict_finished_inbox`` so
the writer drops any leftover ``_push_finished_blocks`` /
``_pending_d_registrations`` and stops self-polling.
