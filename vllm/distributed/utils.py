    A replacement for `torch.distributed.init_process_group` that does not

    some operations such as `allreduce`, because it does not depend on the
    global rank. However, some operations such as `broadcast` cannot be used
    because it depends on the global rank.

    # TODO: ask for help from PyTorch team if we need the `broadcast` operation.

    This function is useful when we are not sure about the total number of
    processes in the process group. For example, we may have process
    1, 2, ..., 8 who want to communicate, and process 9 might be the same
    process as process 1, or it might be a different process; process 10
    might be the same process as process 5, or it might be a different process.
    In this case, how can we reliably form a communication channel within
    process 9 and 10, without affecting the communication channel within
    process 1, 2, ..., 8?

    One possible solution is to figure out if process 9 and 10 are the same
    as process 1 and 5 beforehand, and then form a communication channel
    based on the information, adjusting the ranks and world_size etc. However,
    figuring out the information is not always easy, and it will interfere
    with the main communication channel.

    Our solution is to always form a communication channel with process 1, 2,
    ..., 8, and then use this function to form another communication channel
    with process 9 and 10. This way, regardless of whether process 9 and 10
    are the same as process 1 and 5, the main communication channel is
    always formed with process 1, 2, ..., 8, and the additional communication
    channel is formed with process 9 and 10.
