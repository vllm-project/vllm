    """
    Generates the KV cache groups for hybrid models with multiple
    attention types but still with a uniform page size (physical memory per
    block per layer) for all layers.

    Detailed explanation about kv cache management of hybrid models:
    The layers in the models are repeated with some patterns, e.g., a model
    with 10 full attention layers and 20 sliding window attention layers can be
    regarded as repeating the pattern (1 * full, 2 * sw) 10 times.
    The KVCacheManager allocates different block tables for each of the 3 layers
    in the pattern, and repeats each of them 10 times to generate the
    block_table for the 30 layers in the model.
    Therefore, we can group the layers in the model into 3 kv_cache_groups, each
    of which contains 10 layers in the model.
    The KVCacheManager allocates the block_table for each group based on its
    kv_cache spec, and the model runner applies the block table to each layer
    in the group.
    For example:
    1. A model only uses full attention. The pattern is
    (num_hidden_layers * full), so there is only one group and the block table
    is shared by all layers. It is already handled by
    `_get_kv_cache_config_uniform_type`.
    2. A model with 10 full attention layers and 20 sliding window
    attention layers. There are 3 layers in the pattern (1 * full, 2 * sw), so
    there are 3 kv_cache_groups, each of which represents 10 layers.

    To simplify the implementation, we make the following assumptions:
    1. Physical memory per block: Must be the same across all KV cache groups.
    Breaking this assumption is non-trivial due to memory fragmentation concerns
    when allocating blocks of different sizes.
    2. Tokens per block (block_size): Currently, we directly use
    `CacheConfig.block_size` for all layers. It can be extended to vary by KV
    cache group, but within each KV cache group, all layers must share the same
    block size.
    3. Physical memory per token per layer: This property is decided by model
    config. Currently we only support models that have the same physical memory
    per token per layer for all layers. Can be relaxed with a simple extension,
    but still need to keep physical memory per block the same for all groups.
    4. Number of layers per group: Currently assumed the same for all layers.
    Can be relaxed with a simple extension, but still need to keep physical
    memory per block the same for all groups.
    5. Attention type within groups: All layers in a group must share the same
    attention type. One exception is that, when
    `--disable-hybrid-kv-cache-manager` is true, the single group for full
    attention layers may also include attention layers using sliding window or
    LLaMA 4 local attention. See `unify_hybrid_kv_cache_specs` for more details.
    6. Support for multiple attention types: The design for most components is
    general to an arbitrary number of attention types. But
    `find_longest_cache_hit` only supports one attention type or two
    types of full-attention plus exactly one another type. The general
    implementation of this function is feasible but we don't know how to
    implement it cleanly yet.

    As we assume tokens per block, physical memory per token per layer, and
    number of layers per group are the same now, we can ensure that physical
    memory per block is the same for all groups.

class BlockHashListWithBlockSize:
    """
    Convert block-hash granularity from `hash_block_size` to `target_block_size`.
    Used when KV cache groups have different block sizes: `hash_block_size`
    is the size used to compute the original `block_hashes`; `target_block_size`
    is the group's actual block size.

    Currently, only scaling up by an integer factor is supported (i.e.,
    `target_block_size` is a multiple of `hash_block_size`). Conversion is
    performed lazily on access for efficiency, by concatenating consecutive
    hashes at `hash_block_size` to form each hash at `target_block_size`.

    Example (`hash_block_size` = 16, `target_block_size` = 32):
    concatenating two 16-size hashes yields one 32-size hash:

    Block hashes with block_size 16:
    | Token Range | 0-15 | 16-31 | 32-47 | 48-63 |
    |-------------|------|-------|-------|-------|
    | Hash        | A    | B     | C     | D     |

    Block hashes with block_size 32:
    | Token Range | 0-31 | 32-63 |
    |-------------|------|-------|
    | Hash        | AB   | CD    |

    Args:
        block_hashes: Block hashes to convert, computed at `hash_block_size`.
        hash_block_size: Block size at which `block_hashes` were computed.
        target_block_size: Desired block size; must be a multiple of `hash_block_size`.
