    """
    Cache of blocks that are used for prefix caching. It caches blocks
    from hash directly to a block or multiple blocks
    (i.e. {block_hash: KVCacheBlocks})
    - Mostly block_hash maps to a single KVCacheBlock, and KVCacheBlocks
        would simply be a KVCacheBlock.
    - Otherwise, KVCacheBlocks is a dict from {block_id: KVCacheBlock}

    A cached block is a full block with a block hash that can be used
    for prefix caching.
    The cached block may be used by running requests or in the
    free_block_queue that could potentially be evicted.

    NOTE #1: We currently don't de-duplicate the blocks in the cache,
    meaning that if a block becomes full and is cached, we don't check
    if there is already an identical block in the cache. This is because
    we want to make sure the allocated block IDs won't change so that
    block tables are append-only.
    NOTE #2: The union type is introduced in order to reduce GC costs
    from the inner dict.
