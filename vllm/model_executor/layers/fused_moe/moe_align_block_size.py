    """
    Aligns the token distribution across experts to be compatible with block
    size for matrix multiplication.

    Note: In the case of expert_parallel, moe_align_block_size initially
    considers all experts as valid and aligns all tokens appropriately.
    Before the function returns it marks the experts_ids that are not in
    the current GPU rank as -1 so the MoE matmuls could skip those blocks.
    This requires the num_experts input arg to be the num global experts.

    Parameters:
    - topk_ids: A tensor of shape [total_tokens, top_k] representing the
        top-k expert indices for each token.
    - block_size: The block size used in block matrix multiplication.
    - num_experts: The total number of experts.
    - expert_map: A tensor of shape [num_experts] that maps the expert index
        from the global space to the local index space of the current
        expert parallel shard. If the expert is not in the current expert
        parallel shard, the mapping is set to -1.
    - pad_sorted_ids: A flag indicating whether the sorted_token_ids length
      should be padded to a multiple of block_size,

    Returns:
    - sorted_token_ids: A tensor containing the sorted token indices according
        to their allocated expert.
    - expert_ids: A tensor indicating the assigned expert index for each block.
    - num_tokens_post_padded: The total number of tokens after padding,
        ensuring divisibility by block_size.

    This function pads the number of tokens that each expert needs to process
    so that it is divisible by block_size.
    Padding ensures that during block matrix multiplication, the dimensions
    align correctly.

    Example:
    Given topk_ids = [[2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 4], [1, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3]],
    block_size = 4, and num_experts = 4:
    - We initially have 12 tokens (after repeating 'top_k' times) and 4 experts,
        with each expert needing to process 3 tokens.
    - As block_size is 4, we pad 1 token for each expert.
    - First, flatten topk_ids to [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3].
    - Then append padding tokens [12, 12, 12, 12] for each block.
    - After sorting by expert index, we obtain token_ids
        [3, 6, 9, 12, 0, 4, 10, 12, 1, 7, 11, 12, 2, 5, 8, 12].
        Tokens 12 are non-existent (padding) and are ignored in
        the subsequent matrix multiplication.
    - The padding ensures that the total number of tokens is now divisible
        by block_size for proper block matrix operations.

    """
    Given num_batches, max_tokens_per_batch, block_size and the number of
    valid-tokens in each batch, prepare sorted_token_ids, expert_ids and
    num_tokens_post_pad. sorted_token_ids, expert_ids and num_tokens_post_pad
    have the same semantics as in moe_align_block_size.

    This function is intended to be a drop in replacement for
    moe_align_batch_size for the batched case.

    Parameters:
    - max_tokens_per_batch (int): Number of tokens in each batch (both
        valid and invalid).
    - block_size (int): block_size to align the data to.
    - expert_num_tokens (torch.Tensor): expert_num_tokens[i], indicates
        the number of valid tokens in batch i.

    Returns:
    - sorted_token_ids (torch.Tensor): Torch tensor of size
        (num_batches * max_tokens_per_batch) indicating the token indices for
        that block.
    - expert_ids (torch.Tensor): Torch tensor of size
        ceil((num_batches * max_tokens_per_batch) / block_size) indicating
        what expert to use for each block.
    - num_tokens_post_pad (torch.Tensor): Torch tensor of size 1
        indicating the number of valid blocks with actual data to
        process. This is represented in terms of num tokens.
    Example:
    Let num_batches=5, max_tokens_per_batch=8, block_size=4, and
    expert_num_tokens=[2, 3, 0, 6, 8]. This expert_num_tokens tensor
    indicates that,
     - The first 2 tokens in the 0th batch are valid and the rest 6 are
     invalid (i.e. in the 2D hidden_states tensor of shape,
     [num_batches * max_tokens_per_batch, K], indices 0, 1 are valid)
     - The first 3 tokens in the 1st batch are valid. i.e. indices 8, 9, 10
     - 0 tokens in the 2nd batch are valid
     - first 6 tokens in the  3rd batch are valid. i.e. indices,
     24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29
     - so on ...

     In this case,
      sorted_token_ids will be [0, 1, 40, 40,
                                8, 9, 10, 40,

                                32, 33, 34, 35,
                                36, 37, 38, 39,
                                40, 40, 40, 40,

                                ...]
      Here, 40 represents an invalid index. as there is no token index 40.
      The gemm kernel using this sorted_token_ids is expected to skip the
      gemm computation when it encounters this invalid index.

      expert_ids will be [0, 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, -1, -1, (rest all -1) ...]
      Here, -1 represents an invalid expert. The gemm kernel using this
      expert_ids is expected to skip the gemm computation when it encounters
      an expert of id -1.

      num_tokens_post_pad will be 24 as sorted_token_ids has valid entries
      until 24.
