class BlockSpaceManagerV2(BlockSpaceManager):
    """BlockSpaceManager which manages the allocation of KV cache.

    It owns responsibility for allocation, swapping, allocating memory for
    autoregressively-generated tokens, and other advanced features such as
    prefix caching, forking/copy-on-write, and sliding-window memory allocation.

    The current implementation is partial; in particular prefix caching and
    sliding-window are not feature complete. This class implements the design
    described in https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/3492.

    Lookahead slots
        The block manager has the notion of a "lookahead slot". These are slots
        in the KV cache that are allocated for a sequence. Unlike the other
        allocated slots, the content of these slots is undefined -- the worker
        may use the memory allocations in any way.

        In practice, a worker could use these lookahead slots to run multiple
        forward passes for a single scheduler invocation. Each successive
        forward pass would write KV activations to the corresponding lookahead
        slot. This allows low inter-token latency use-cases, where the overhead
        of continuous batching scheduling is amortized over >1 generated tokens.

        Speculative decoding uses lookahead slots to store KV activations of
        proposal tokens.

        See https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/3250 for more information
        on lookahead scheduling.
