"""A kernel's mailbox accesses, recorded while FlyDSL traces it.

Tracing runs the kernel body's Python once, so every mailbox put / poll executes
once as Python: noting it here costs the device nothing (no IR is emitted). The
stage currently being traced is set by ``enter_stage``, called where the program
starts each stage, so the record is ``(stage, region, put | poll)`` in program
order.

Everything here is plain functions on a module-level recorder: FlyDSL's AST
rewriter carries every local whose method is called inside a dynamic if / for as
loop state, so a kernel body must not call methods on these objects.
